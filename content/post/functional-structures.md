Informal talk series that presents the major functional programming type classes in Scala.

Talks are intended to complement the fantastic Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason (http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/).

Given the informal nature of the talks, there are mistakes. Errata will be posted on each talk in the descriptions.
