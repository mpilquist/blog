My name is Michael Pilquist. I'm a software architect residing in the greater Philadelphia area. I frequently speak at conferences and user groups about functional programming and the Scala programming language.

I'm also an active open source contributor. Notable projects include:
 - [scodec](http://scodec.org)
 - [fs2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2)
 - [simulacrum](https://github.com/mpilquist/simulacrum)

I'm the author of the second edition of [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala-second-edition), built upon the work by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason from the first edition.

This site includes articles about functional programming in Scala and links to my conference talks and screencasts. Reach me on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@mpilquist) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mpilquist).
