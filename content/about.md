My name is Michael Pilquist. I'm a software architect residing in the greater Philadelphia area. I frequently speak at conferences and user groups about functional programming and the Scala programming language.

I'm also an active open source contributor. Notable projects include [scodec](http://scodec.org), [simulacrum](https://github.com/mpilquist/simulacrum), and [fs2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2).

This site includes articles about functional programming in Scala and links to my conference talks and screencasts. Reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mpilquist) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mpilquist).
